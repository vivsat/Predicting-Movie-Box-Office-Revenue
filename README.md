# Predicting-Movie-Box-Office-Revenue
📌 Project Overview

This project dives into the exciting world of predicting movie box office revenue using the power of machine learning. By sifting through historical data—like budgets, genres, and release dates—we aim to forecast how much a film will rake in, helping studios reduce risks and fine-tune marketing plans. Expect a journey through data preprocessing, insightful exploratory analysis, and robust model training!
